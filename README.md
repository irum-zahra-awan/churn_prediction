# churn_prediction
ML Model is developed and made operational for all product locations to identify and segment the users who are most likely to churn (not buy 2021 product and having 2020 product ) into 3 levels of churn risk(Low,medium,High) . This will help marketing to drive campaign and focus on those specific set of users with retaining strategy etc.

The model has to be updated every 2 weeks to take in new data of users and  make predictions to adjust the risk segment accordingly.
